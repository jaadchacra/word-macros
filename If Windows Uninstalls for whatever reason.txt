Install Office
	In case the setup is no longer downloadable, I put a copy of it in same folder as this (Microsoft Word Settigns)
	Run the OfficeSetup.exe (it will install Word)

Now you need the Normal.dotm template
	Check "How to replace Normal.dotm" file in same folder as this (Microsoft Word Settigns)
